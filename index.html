        Hey there! My name is Wes and I am a full-stack developer from Atlanta, Georgia! My focus is HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My specialties include Node.js, React.js, Express, PostgreSQL!
        I'd say my strengths lie with frontend development in particular! My favorite aspect of frontend is completing apps that have wonderful interfaces. 
        In my free time, I write, record and produce music.
        I enjoy coffee and casual tabletop games as well.<br> 

        <br> I attended Thinkful in the year 2021, which produced most of my linked projects below. Throughout the program, I had the priviledge of speaking with industry-level
        professionals. My time with Thinkful also allowed me to garner a disiplined autonomy, leading me to nurture my self-motivation. 
        <br> 


       <br>
        As a developer, I have a large interest in software and app development. That's where a lot of my energy goes. Yet, 
        I have a side interest in Raspberry and Arduino systems! I'm currently learning how to interact with
        these systems, and what capabilities they have. It's extremely exciting, and it is a very rewarding way to utilize code. 
        Another way I find myself learning and using code is within the Unity3D environment. Unity is something I've been dabbling with since 2015,
        yet it wasn't until this year that I truly found a path for myself. I hope to make some small, fun games that showcase my interactive code.

        Here are some of my projects! These exemplify the work I'm most proud of and showcase my current skill level. Of course, this website itself is one of my happiest projects! I am thrilled to show it off, as it is my cleanest and most modern work yet.

             <h5>ThinkfulBnB</h5>
             <p>
               This is my ThinkfulBnB project! This website was given to me in an unfinished state, and I was asked to complete it
               in a certain format. The request was furnished with images and my job specifically entailed modifying the webpage to look 
               as close as possible to those images. This project tested my ability to alter pre-written code, or code written by someone
               else. Careful reading went into this, and to accurately model the request, I employed my own technical choices to achieve 
               as close a product as possible! Have a look!

              <h5>Decoder Ring</h5>
              <p>
                Here is a Decoder Ring project, in which I was tasked with creating an app that decoded Caesar Shift and Polybius
                style encoding. This was particularly focused on logic, and secondarily - intertwining HTML and JavaScript. It was quite
                a challenge, but rewarding in many ways! I learned how to manage an app request, and how to ensure my layout was logistical 
                and easy to read. When linking the JavaScript to the HTML, I learned how to make clean exports and imports. Naming goes a 
                long way! Have a peek!
